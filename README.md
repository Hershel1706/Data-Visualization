# Portfolio
This will be my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University. Welcome to my universe!

# About Me
Hi! My name is Ibrahim Kante. I love watching and playing soccer. Academically though, I have a keen interest in policymaking. My portfolio will surely reflect those interests and I hope you will enjoy them.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to continually improve my data visualization skills, even beyond the classroom.
